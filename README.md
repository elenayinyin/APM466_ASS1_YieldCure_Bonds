# APM466_ASS1_YieldCure_Bonds

**Process:**
- Select 10 bonds as shown below. Consider the semi-annual coupon, timing of these 10 bonds ideally have maturity dates separated by six months evenly.

- Calculate the interpolated yield curve of 10 selected bonds over 5 years. Following proper formula, calculate the the interpolated spot-rate curve over 5 years. Lastly, calculate the one-year forward curve over 5 years.

- Manual PCA process: calculate two covariance matrices for the time series of daily log-returns of yield and forward rates. Then derive eigenvalues and eigenvectors of both covariance matrices.
